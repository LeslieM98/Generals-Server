# Generals Game
## The Game
### Description
This is based on a game played by old Prussian military to train their strategic thinking.
This App is a virtualization of said game.

### Basic Setup
Players:
 - 2 Teams of players (usually 2 players per team but can also be more or less)
 - 1 Player as Gamemaster (GM)
 
The game is played on 4 different viewpoints at the same time:
 - Gamemaster view
 - Team 1 (T1) view
 - Team 2 (T2) view
 - Game overview
 
### Basic Rules
Each team gets troops assigned at the beginning of the game.

 - T1 sees all their troops on T1 view. Only visible by T1.
 - T2 sees all their troops on T2 view. Only visible by T2.
 - The GM sees all troops on the GM view. Only visible by the GM.
 - The game overview shows only troops that have line of sight to each other. 
   Visible by everyone.

A player only has vague control over their troops. 
The GM has full control over all troops. 
The game works in the following phases in order:

#### Commanding phase
Players have limited time (usually 30s-60s) to write their commands on a sheet of paper and passes it to the GM.
Players are only allowed to discuss their strategy and further ongoing within this phase.

#### Execution phase     
In this phase the GM evaluates the sheets passed to them. 
Only things that are stated explicitly on the paper are informations and instructions the GM can utilize.
According on the wording, how rude or vague it is, the GM now moves the troops accordingly.
As soon as two troops are able to see eachother, they have to be made visible on the game overview.
As soon as only one Team is able to spot a troop by the other team, the unknowing troop has to be made visible on the Teams view that spotted them.
If needed an attack can be performed.
At the end of the phase the GM returns notes that state informations to the according teams.
